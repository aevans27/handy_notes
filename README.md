# Handy Notes
## The purpose of this repo is to create an easy place for me to refer too for important notes of things that I will need but don't use regularly.
### This will include the lessons from Turing and loose notes I have taken.
- Installation steps
- Solutions to specific or unique problems
- Sometimes just to organize random notes from my classes at Turning
- Project solutions or ideas with other students (that are ok to be public)
